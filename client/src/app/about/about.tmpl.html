  <h2>Current Projects</h2>

  <p>
    This very own website. I have just recently updated this site to an Angular.js front end with an
    <strike>ASP.NET WebAPIbackend</strike>
    MEAN stack backend (MySQL - <i>I believe Mongo is unnecessary for this</i>, ExpressJS and NodeJS).
    I am open sourcing the code for it and will write some blog posts about some of the methods I used to create (blog
    posts I wish I could have found while developing it). Checkout the code on my
    <a href="https://github.com/GentryRiggen" target="_blank">GitHub account.</a>

      <p>
        I wrote <a href="http://gymbagnotebook.com" target="#">Gym Bag Notebook</a> for Windows Phone back in Auguts
        2012.
        The idea for the app was to replace a notebook that I carried with me to the gym to track my workouts.
        The app was well received and even a winner in a Nokia 'App of the Month' contest.
