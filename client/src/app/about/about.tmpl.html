  <h4 >GentryRiggen.com</h4>
  <p>
    This very own website is a constant passion project of mine.
    I have just recently updated this site to an Angular.js front end with an
    <strike>LAMP</strike> <strike>ASP.NET WebAPI backend</strike>
    MEAN stack backend (MySQL, ExpressJS, AngularJS and NodeJS).
  </p>

  <p>Things I am proud of about this project:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <a href="/#!/health">Health</a> section is where I integrate with the Microsoft Cloud API to gather data about my fitness band.</li>
    <li>The <a href="/#!/health">Library</a> section is where I get to share the books I have enjoyed recently.</li>
  </ul>

  <!--<h2>Past Projects</h2>-->

  <!--<h4>Gym Bag Notebook</h4>-->
  <!--<p>-->
    <!--I wrote <a href="http://gymbagnotebook.com" target="#">Gym Bag Notebook</a> for Windows Phone back in August 2012.-->
    <!--I had been doing Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) development for work at the time so it was an easy gap to do Windows Phone development.-->
    <!--The idea for the app was to replace a notebook that I carried with me to the gym to track my workouts.-->
    <!--The app was well received and even a winner in a Nokia 'App of the Month' contest.-->
