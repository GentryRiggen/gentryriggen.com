    <h1>My Library</h1>

    <p>
      I love to read and I love to see what others enjoy and recommend. It's like going into
      someones house and seeing their library. It can tell you a lot about a person. What they're interested in
      and what they dream about. It's similar to seeing what music someone has on their iPod.
      It helps when getting to know them.

      I am a very recent sci fi fanatic but I have always really enjoyed a good biography and non-fiction book.
      Here is my library so that you can get to know me better and see what I enjoy.
