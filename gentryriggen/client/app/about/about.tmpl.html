        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Gentry Riggen. I was born and raised in Colorado and still live there today.
            I'm a software developer at <a href="http://trainheroic.com" target="#">TrainHeroic</a>
            where I get to work on web and mobile platforms to help strength professionals coach athletes
            from anywhere in the world. This blog is my space to share my learnings, interests and rants.
        </p>

        <h2>Current Projects</h2>
        <p>
            This very own website. I have just recently updated this site to an Angular.js front end with an ASP.NET Web API backend.
            I am open sourcing the code for it and will write some blog posts about some of the methods I used to create (blog posts I wish I could have found while developing it).
        </p>

                    I wrote <a href="http://gymbagnotebook.com" target="#">Gym Bag Notebook</a> for Windows Phone back in Auguts 2012.
                    The idea for the app was to replace a notebook that I carried with me to the gym to track my workouts.
                    The app was well received and even a winner in a Nokia 'App of the Month' contest.
